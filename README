I would like to suggest adding an industrial color scheme to the next Vim release.
I used to work and program for machines in industrial environment. The main difference between industrial environment and desktop environment is the immediate risk for human lives.
Therefore, colors are highly important and very meaningful in industry. 
Just take for example the traffic lights: imagine the green as blue or the red as brown... that could certainly cause an accident, since we all associate colors with meanings (as I briefly described in the header of the source file). 
From my personal experience, designing an HMI (Human-Machine-Interface) with non-standard colors, reduces productivity, risks human lives, and makes the workers tired quicker.
I assume that the standard industrial color scheme might be helpful also in the desktop environment.
I would like to offer this color scheme to Vim maintainer, Bram.
Is there any objection?
